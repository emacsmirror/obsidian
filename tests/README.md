# Test Vault Notes
## File Names
### Unique File Names
Obsidian works best if each file has a unique file name, even between subdirectories.  If two files have the same name, some functionality may not work as expected, for example determining backlinks.

### Spaces in Markdown links
The URL portion of a markdown link must not contain spaces; if it does, the various parts can be mistaken for a title portion.

### External links
External links don't work inside of wiki-links.

Bad link: [[https://example.com]]
